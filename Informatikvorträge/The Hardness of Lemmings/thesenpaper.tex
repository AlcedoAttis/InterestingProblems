The complexity of ``Lemmings'' is a topic in the research of games, more specifically computer games. And although it is a relatively simple game, it was still proposed as a training for artificial intelligence because of its relative difficulty despite of the simple rules and levels. Therefor, knowledge of the complexity of ``Lemmings'' would be quite helpful in determining if this would be a useful problem that an algorithm could be trained on.

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Lemmings'' can be valuable for training an artificial intelligence as it proves to be hard enough to defy brute forcing.
\item A reduction from a ``Lemmings'' level to 3SAT is possible
\item Solutions for some levels can only be found in exponential time. (if~\emph{P}$\neq$\emph{NP})
\item Solutions for all levels can be checked in polynoial time.
\item[$\hookrightarrow$] ``Lemmings'' is \emph{NP}-Complete.
\item The above holds true for levels with only 1 Lemming, too.
\end{itemize}
